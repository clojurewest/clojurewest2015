## What's This?

This folder collects slides from the [Clojure/West](http://clojurewest.org) 2015 sessions.

If you try to download slides and see a "Blob too big" error, then the file is too large for GitHub to serve through it's web API. In that case, you should clone the repo:

```git clone https://github.com/clojurewest/ClojureWest2015.git```

If you are a speaker adding slides, please use naming convention Lastname-TalkTitle.pdf. PDF is preferred but feel free to upload in whatever format is appropriate. 

If you are hosting slides online at another location, please upload a Lastname-TalkTitle.md Markdown file with a link to the location or whatever information is necessary to see the slides.
